## Workflow

1.  **Data Retrieval**: The skill connects to various analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, SimilarWeb, etc.) to fetch raw data.
2.  **Data Processing**: It then processes and cleans the data, preparing it for analysis.
3.  **Data Analysis**: The skill performs analysis on the processed data, identifying key trends, metrics, and insights.
4.  **Report Generation**: Finally, it generates a comprehensive report in a user-friendly format (e.g., Markdown, PDF), including visualizations like charts and graphs.

## Usage

The user needs to provide the following inputs:

- The analytics data sources and credentials.
- The desired date range for the report.
- The key metrics and dimensions to be included in the analysis.
- The output format for the report.

## Example

A user wants to generate a monthly SEO report for their website. They would provide the skill with access to their Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. The skill would then fetch data on organic traffic, keyword rankings, and backlink profiles. It would analyze this data to identify top-performing content, keyword opportunities, and areas for improvement. The final output would be a Markdown document with charts visualizing the trends in organic traffic and keyword rankings, along with a summary of key findings and recommendations.
