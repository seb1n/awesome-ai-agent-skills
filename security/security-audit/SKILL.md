# Security Audit

This skill enables the agent to conduct a security audit of a web application or smart contract. The agent can identify common vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure authentication, and provide recommendations for fixing them.

## Workflow

1.  **Gather information:** The agent will gather information about the target application, including its technology stack, architecture, and functionality.
2.  **Scan for vulnerabilities:** The agent will use a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Analyze and prioritize findings:** The agent will analyze the findings, assess their severity, and prioritize them based on the potential impact.
4.  **Generate an audit report:** The agent will produce a detailed report that describes the vulnerabilities, provides evidence of their existence, and recommends specific mitigation strategies.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the agent with the URL of the web application or the source code of the smart contract you want to be audited.

**Example:**

```
Perform a security audit of the following web application:

https://example.com
```
