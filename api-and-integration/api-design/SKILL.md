# API Design

This skill enables the agent to design a RESTful API. The agent can define resources, endpoints, and data models, and generate API documentation.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify resources:** The agent will identify the resources that the API will expose.
2.  **Define endpoints:** The agent will define the endpoints for each resource, including the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL paths.
3.  **Design data models:** The agent will design the data models for each resource, specifying the fields and data types.
4.  **Generate API documentation:** The agent will generate API documentation in a standard format, such as OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger).

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the agent with a description of the application and the data that the API will expose.

**Example:**

```
Design a RESTful API for a blog application.

- The API should expose resources for posts, comments, and users.
- Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete posts and comments.
- The API should be well-documented and easy to use.
```
