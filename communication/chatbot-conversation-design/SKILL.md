## Chatbot Conversation Design Skill

This skill provides a structured workflow for designing high-quality chatbot conversations that are both engaging and effective.

### Workflow

1.  **Define Persona and Goals**: Establish the chatbot's personality (e.g., friendly, professional, witty) and define the primary objectives it should help users achieve.

2.  **Map User Journeys**: Outline the possible paths users can take. Visualize the conversation flow from the initial greeting to the final resolution.

3.  **Write Dialogue**: Craft the script for the conversation. This includes defining user intents (what the user wants to do), entities (key pieces of information), and the chatbot's responses.

4.  **Prototype and Test**: Build a low-fidelity prototype of the conversation to test the flow and identify potential issues. Use tools like Botmock or create a simple script.

5.  **Iterate and Refine**: Gather feedback from user testing and refine the conversation design. This is an ongoing process to continuously improve the user experience.

### Usage

This skill is intended for developers, UX writers, and product managers who are building chatbots. It provides a systematic approach to conversation design, ensuring a user-centric focus.

-   **For New Chatbots**: Follow the workflow from start to finish to build a solid conversational foundation.
-   **For Existing Chatbots**: Use the workflow to audit and improve your current conversation design.

### Example: Pizza Ordering Chatbot

-   **Persona**: Friendly and helpful Pizza Assistant.
-   **Goal**: To help users order a pizza for delivery.

-   **User Journey**:
    1.  User initiates the conversation.
    2.  Chatbot greets the user and asks what they would like to order.
    3.  User specifies the type of pizza, size, and toppings.
    4.  Chatbot confirms the order details and total price.
    5.  User provides their address and payment information.
    6.  Chatbot confirms the order and provides an estimated delivery time.

-   **Sample Dialogue**:

    *   **User**: "Hi, I'd like to order a pizza."
    *   **Chatbot**: "Of course! I can help with that. What kind of pizza would you like to order today?"
    *   **User**: "A large pepperoni pizza."
    *   **Chatbot**: "Excellent choice! One large pepperoni pizza. Anything else for you today?"
