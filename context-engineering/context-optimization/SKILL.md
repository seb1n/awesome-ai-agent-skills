# Context Optimization

This skill enables the agent to optimize the context provided to it to improve its performance and reduce token usage. The agent can analyze the context, identify irrelevant information, and suggest ways to make the context more concise and effective.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze the context:** The agent will analyze the provided context to understand its structure and content.
2.  **Identify irrelevant information:** The agent will identify and remove any information that is not relevant to the current task.
3.  **Summarize and condense information:** The agent will summarize and condense the information to make it more concise.
4.  **Suggest context improvements:** The agent will suggest ways to improve the context, such as using more specific keywords, providing more examples, or structuring the information in a more organized way.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the agent with the context that you want to optimize.

**Example:**

```
Optimize the following context for a customer support chatbot:

---

**User:** I'm having trouble with my order.

**Chatbot:** I can help with that. What is your order number?

**User:** I don't have it. I placed the order last week.

**Chatbot:** Can you tell me your name and email address?

**User:** My name is John Smith and my email is john.smith@example.com.
