## Workflow

2.  **Gather and structure information:** The agent will collect the necessary information and organize it in a logical and easy-to-follow structure.
3.  **Write the content:** The agent will write the documentation, using clear and simple language, and providing code examples and illustrations where appropriate.
4.  **Review and revise:** The agent will review the documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness, and make any necessary revisions.

## Usage
