## Workflow

1.  **Provide Text**: The user provides the text to be proofread.
2.  **Proofread**: The agent proofreads the text, identifying and correcting errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style.
3.  **Suggest Improvements**: The agent can optionally suggest improvements to clarity, tone, and readability.
4.  **Return Corrected Text**: The agent returns the corrected text to the user.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the text you want to be proofread. You can also specify the desired style guide (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) or tone (e.g., formal, informal, academic).

## Example

**User Request**: "Please proofread the following email draft: 'Hi team, just a quick reminder that the deadline for the Q3 report is this Friday. Please make sure to submit your sections by then. Thanks.'"

**Agent Response**: "Hi team, just a quick reminder that the deadline for the Q3 report is this Friday. Please make sure to submit your sections by then. Thanks."
(No errors found in this example, but if there were, they would be corrected.)
