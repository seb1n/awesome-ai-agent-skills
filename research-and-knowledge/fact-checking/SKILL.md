## Workflow

1. **Input**: The user provides a statement or claim to be fact-checked.
2. **Search**: The agent searches for information related to the claim from multiple reputable sources (e.g., news articles, scientific papers, fact-checking websites).
3. **Analysis**: The agent analyzes the search results to identify corroborating and conflicting information.
4. **Synthesis**: The agent synthesizes the findings into a summary that includes a verdict on the claim's accuracy (e.g., true, false, partially true, misleading) and supporting evidence.
5. **Output**: The agent presents the summary and evidence to the user.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide a claim to be fact-checked. For example:

```
fact-check: "The sky is green."
```

## Example

**User Request**:

> Fact-check the claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space.

**Agent Response**:

> The claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye is a common misconception. While some astronauts have claimed to see it under specific conditions, it is not consistently visible. NASA and other space agencies have confirmed that it is not visible from low Earth orbit. Therefore, the claim is largely considered to be false.
