# Data Analysis

This skill enables the agent to perform data analysis on a given dataset. The agent can identify trends, patterns, and outliers, and generate visualizations to communicate its findings.

## Workflow

1.  **Load and explore the data:** The agent will load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand its structure and contents.
2.  **Clean and preprocess the data:** The agent will handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and perform any necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
3.  **Perform statistical analysis:** The agent will use statistical methods to identify trends, correlations, and other significant patterns in the data.
4.  **Create visualizations:** The agent will generate charts, graphs, and other visualizations to present the findings in a clear and concise manner.
5.  **Generate a report:** The agent will produce a summary of its findings, including key insights and visualizations.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the agent with the path to the dataset file (e.g., CSV, Excel) and specify the analysis goals.

**Example:**

```
/path/to/your/dataset.csv

Analyze the sales data to identify the top-selling products and the regions with the highest revenue.
```
