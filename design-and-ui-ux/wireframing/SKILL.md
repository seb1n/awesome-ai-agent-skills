## Workflow

1.  **Deconstruct the UI:** Break down the user interface into its core components (e.g., header, footer, sidebar, content area).
2.  **Component-by-Component Generation:** Generate a wireframe for each component individually. This allows for a more focused and iterative approach.
3.  **Assemble the Wireframe:** Combine the individual component wireframes into a cohesive full-page layout.
4.  **Review and Refine:** Review the assembled wireframe for clarity, usability, and adherence to the initial requirements. Make adjustments as needed.

## Usage

This skill is designed to be used in a sequential manner, following the workflow outlined above. It is best suited for projects where a clear and simple visual representation of the UI is needed before moving on to high-fidelity design or development.

## Example

**Goal:** Create a wireframe for a simple blog homepage.

**Steps:**

1.  **Deconstruct the UI:**
    *   Header: Logo, navigation links
    *   Main Content: List of blog posts with titles and excerpts
    *   Sidebar: Search bar, recent posts
    *   Footer: Copyright information, social media links

2.  **Component-by-Component Generation:**
    *   Generate a wireframe for the header.
    *   Generate a wireframe for the main content area.
    *   Generate a wireframe for the sidebar.
    *   Generate a wireframe for the footer.

3.  **Assemble the Wireframe:** Combine the generated wireframes into a single page layout.

4.  **Review and Refine:** Ensure the layout is logical and all necessary elements are present. Make any necessary adjustments to the arrangement or content of the wireframe components.
