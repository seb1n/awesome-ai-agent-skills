# Frontend Design

This skill enables the agent to design and create high-quality frontend interfaces. The agent can generate wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, and produce production-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand the user requirements:** The agent will work with the user to understand the goals of the application, the target audience, and any specific design preferences.
2.  **Create wireframes and mockups:** The agent will create low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups to visualize the layout and user flow of the application.
3.  **Develop interactive prototypes:** The agent will build interactive prototypes to allow for user testing and feedback.
4.  **Generate production-ready code:** The agent will produce clean, efficient, and well-documented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be deployed to production.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide the agent with a description of the application you want to build and any relevant design assets or branding guidelines.

**Example:**

```
Design a landing page for our new SaaS product, "AnalyticsPro."

- The target audience is data analysts and business intelligence professionals.
- The page should be clean, modern, and professional.
- We have a logo and a color palette that you should use.
```
